/// A directive for a single invocation of a Solana program.
///
/// An instruction specifies which program it is calling, which accounts it may
/// read or modify, and additional data that serves as input to the program. One
/// or more instructions are included in transactions submitted by Solana
/// clients. Instructions are also used to describe `cross-program
/// invocations <https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs/>`_.
///
/// During execution, a program will receive a list of account data as one of
/// its arguments, in the same order as specified during ``Instruction``
/// construction.
///
/// While Solana is agnostic to the format of the instruction data, it has
/// built-in support for serialization via
/// `borsh <https://docs.rs/borsh/latest/borsh/>`_
/// and `bincode <https://docs.rs/bincode/latest/bincode/>`_.
///
/// When constructing an ``Instruction``, a list of all accounts that may be
/// read or written during the execution of that instruction must be supplied as
/// :class:`AccountMeta` values.
///
/// **Specifying Account Metadata**
///
/// Any account whose data may be mutated by the program during execution must
/// be specified as writable. During execution, writing to an account that was
/// not specified as writable will cause the transaction to fail. Writing to an
/// account that is not owned by the program will cause the transaction to fail.
///
/// Any account whose lamport balance may be mutated by the program during
/// execution must be specified as writable. During execution, mutating the
/// lamports of an account that was not specified as writable will cause the
/// transaction to fail. While *subtracting* lamports from an account not owned
/// by the program will cause the transaction to fail, *adding* lamports to any
/// account is allowed, as long is it is mutable.
///
/// Accounts that are not read or written by the program may still be specified
/// in an ``Instruction``'s account list. These will affect scheduling of program
/// execution by the runtime, but will otherwise be ignored.
///
/// When building a transaction, the Solana runtime coalesces all accounts used
/// by all instructions in that transaction, along with accounts and permissions
/// required by the runtime, into a single account list. Some accounts and
/// account permissions required by the runtime to process a transaction are
/// *not* required to be included in an ``Instruction``'s account list. These
/// include:
///
/// * The program ID: it is a separate field of ``Instruction``
/// * The transaction's fee-paying account: it is added during :class:`~solders.message.Message`
///   construction. A program may still require the fee payer as part of the
///   account list if it directly references it.
///
///
/// Programs may require signatures from some accounts, in which case they
/// should be specified as signers during ``Instruction`` construction. The
/// program must still validate during execution that the account is a signer.
///
/// Args:
///     program_id (Pubkey): Pubkey of the program that executes this instruction.
///     data (bytes): Opaque data passed to the program for its own interpretation.
///     accounts (list[AccountMeta]): Metadata describing accounts that should be passed to the program.
